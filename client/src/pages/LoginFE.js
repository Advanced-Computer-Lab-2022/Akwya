  1. Akwya's Rights to Content You Post
  <br/>
  You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses. Weâ€™re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it 
  via advertising on other websites. The content you post as an instructor (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other content, you allow Akwya to reuse 
  and share it but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content. When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas 
  and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize Akwya to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any 
  media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit. In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, 
  non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content 
  (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed). This includes making your content available to other 
  companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Akwya for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on other media, as well as using your 
  content for marketing purposes. You also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature applicable to all these uses, to the extent permissible 
  under applicable law. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that you submit. You also 
  agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you. 
  <br/>
  2. License to Akwya 
  <br/>
  You grant Akwya the rights to offer, market, and otherwise exploit your Submitted Content. This includes the right to add captions or otherwise modify Submitted Content to 
  ensure accessibility. You also authorize Akwya to sublicense these rights to your Submitted Content to third parties, including to students directly and through third 
  parties such as resellers, distributors, affiliate sites, deal sites, and paid advertising on third-party platforms. Unless otherwise agreed (including within our 
  Promotions Policy), you have the right to remove all or any portion of your Submitted Content from the Services at any time. Except as otherwise agreed, Akwya's right to 
  sublicense the rights in this section will terminate with respect to new users 60 days after the Submitted Content's removal. However,<br/>(1) rights given to students 
  before the Submitted Content's removal will continue in accordance with the terms of those licenses (including any grants of lifetime access) and <br/>(2) Akwya's right 
  to use such Submitted Content for marketing purposes shall survive termination. We may record and use all or any part of your Submitted Content for quality control and 
  for delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, or operating the Services. You grant Akwya permission to use your name, likeness, voice, and image in connection 
  with offering, delivering, marketing, promoting, demonstrating, and selling the Services, your Submitted Content, or Akwya's content, and you waive any rights of privacy, 
  publicity, or other rights of a similar nature, to the extent permissible under applicable law.
  <br/>
  3. Revenue Share 
  <br/>
  When a trainee purchases your Submitted Content, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually received by Akwya from the trainee ("Gross Amount"). 
  From this, we subtract any Transaction Taxes, any mobile platform fees applied to mobile provider checkout sales, a 3% service and processing fee (except in Japan, 
  where we subtract a 4% fee) for any non-mobile provider checkout sales, and any amounts paid to third parties in connection with the Promotional Programs to calculate the 
  net amount of the sale ("Net Amount"). If you have not opted into any of Akwya's optional Promotional Programs, and except for sales through instructor-generated coupon 
  codes or course referral links as described below, your revenue share will be 37% of the Net Amount less any applicable deductions, such as trainee refunds. If we change 
  this payment rate, we will provide you 30 days notice using prominent means, such as via email or by posting a notice through our Services. If you opt into any of the 
  Promotional Programs, the relevant revenue share may be different and will be as specified in the Promotions Policy. Akwya makes all instructor payments in U.S. dollars 
  (USD) regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. Akwya is not responsible for your foreign currency conversion fees, wiring fees, or any other processing 
  fees that you may incur. Your revenue report will show the sales price (in local currency) and your converted revenue amount (in USD).
